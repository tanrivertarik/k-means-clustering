## Clustered Mall Customer Data - Readme (K-Means Clustering)

This directory contains the results of clustering customer data from a mall using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The original data, named "Mall_customers.csv" (or a similar format) likely included features such as:

* **CustomerID:** Unique identifier for each customer
* **Annual Income (USD):** Customer's annual income
* **Spending Score (1-100):** Score indicating a customer's spending habits (higher score means more spending)

**K-Means Clustering:**

K-means is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique that partitions data points into a predefined number of clusters (k). In this case, the data was clustered based on the following features:

* **Annual Income (USD)**
* **Spending Score (1-100)**

The K-Means algorithm iteratively refines the clusters by:

1.  Randomly selecting k initial centroids (cluster centers).
2. Assigning each data point to the closest centroid based on distance (usually Euclidean distance).
3. Recalculating the centroid for each cluster as the mean of the points assigned to that cluster.
4. Repeating steps 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer significantly change, indicating convergence.

**Clustering Results:**

This directory contains the following files related to the K-Means clustering:

* **clustered_data.csv (or similar format):** This file contains the original data with an additional column indicating the cluster each customer belongs to.
* **clustering_report.txt (or alternative format):** This file contains details about the K-Means clustering process, including the number of clusters (k) chosen, the distance metric used, and any relevant metrics used to evaluate the clustering quality (e.g., silhouette score).
* **(Optional) visualizations.png/jpg (or similar format):** This file (if included) may contain visualizations of the clusters, such as scatter plots or dimensionality reduction techniques to help understand the separation between clusters.

**Usage:**

The clustered data file can be used for further analysis, such as:

* Identifying customer segments with distinct spending behaviors based on their cluster assignments.
* Developing targeted marketing campaigns for different customer clusters.
* Understanding the relationship between annual income and spending score within each cluster.

**Note:**

* This readme provides a general template. Specific details like file formats and visualizations may vary depending on the K-Means implementation used.
* Consult the clustering_report.txt for specific details about the number of clusters chosen (k) and the evaluation metrics used.
